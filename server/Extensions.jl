### abstract type ServerExtension
Server extensions are loaded into the server on startup, and
can have a few different abilities according to their type
field's value. There are three types to be aware of.

### Logger
out::String

------------------
##### Field Info
- out::String
Rgw output file for the logger to write to.
- log::Function
A Logger logs information with different levels. Holds the function log(),
connected to the function _log(). Methods:
- log(::Int64, ::String)
- log(::String)
- log(::HTTP.Stream, ::String)
Writes to HTML console, and also logs at level 1 with logger.
- levels::Dict

### _log(level::Int64, message::String, levels::Dict, out::String) -> _
------------------
Binded call for the field log() inside of Logger(). See ?(Logger) for more
    details on the field log. All arguments are fields of that type. Return is a
    printout into the REPL as well as an append to the log file, provided by the
    out URI.

Dict of routes as an argument. The last is a function argument, which is just a
specific function to run from the top-end to the server.
